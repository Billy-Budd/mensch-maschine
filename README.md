# [mensch-maschine](https://github.com/Billy-Budd/mensch-maschine/)
Code and projects from CS4375.004 Machine Learning course with Karen Mazidi. The document said to use underscores instead of spaces, but hyphens are more typical of the GitHub repositories that I've encountered, so I will be using hyphens. 

Included in this repo is [Overview-of-ML](Overview-of-ML.pdf) which contains the answers to questions to the [Assignment: Portfolio Setup](/metropolis/assignment-portfolio-setup/portfolio-setup.pdf), including the instructions to create a [GitHub portfolio](/metropolis/Assignment-Portfolio-Setup/create-github-portfolio.pdf).  

**Please note that each header in this file links to it's corresponding folder. I tried to include all of the links from metropolis as they came up, but a full table of contents can be found [here](metropolis.md).**

Name is in reference to the [Gesamtkunstwerk](https://www.theartstory.org/definition/gesamtkunstwerk/) of [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk), an early-electronica German band, and their electronic music discography. [The Man-Machine or Die Mensch-Maschine](https://youtu.be/EPxGE1xWl_E?list=PLRp2a3r7tvpd3NpB_CwUbOoLxRgY4CwHh) is a [1978 electronic album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man-Machine) that felt like an appropriate name and naming scheme for my projects in this machine learning course. 

## [blue-monday](/blue-monday)
The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) is a set of weather data for the country of Australia. It is also [here](/blue-monday/weatherAUS.csv). Both R programs use the data set to try and predict some aspect of Australia's weather. Regression attempts to predict pressure by using rainfall amounts, and classification attempts to predict whether it will rain tomorrow if it rained today. Both go into more detail which can be found in their .pdfs or in their source code. 

- the PDF of regression.rmd can be found [here](/blue-monday/Regression.pdf)
- the PDF of classification.rmd can be found [here](blue-monday/Classification.pdf)
- source for regression can be found [here](/blue-monday/Regression.rmd)
- source for classification can be found [here](/blue-monday/Classification.Rmd)

Name is in reference to the song [Blue Monday](https://youtu.be/c1GxjzHm5us) by [New Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(band)) which [samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(New_Order_song)) the song [Uranium](https://youtu.be/t-QIWXiGuGw). While this is a bit of a stretch in the naming scheme, taking samples is important in data collection and statistics. I also really wanted to name something after Blue Monday. 

## [das-model](/das-model)
There are two programs [1](/das-model/das-model-linreg.cpp) [2](/das-model/the-model-naivebayes.cpp) that perform analysis on the [titanic data set](/das-model/titanic_project.csv). Some pictures of the output are in the document [here](/das-model/CS4375-algorithms-from-scratch-response.pdf). 

- the PDF response is [here](/das-model/CS4375-algorithms-from-scratch-response.pdf)
- the dataset is [here](/das-model/titanic_project.csv)
- the source for linreg is [here](/das-model/das-model-linreg.cpp)
- the source for naivebayes is [here](/das-model/the-model-naivebayes.cpp)
- the executable for linreg is [here](/das-model/das-model-linreg.exe)
- the executable for naivebayes is [here](/das-model/the-model-naivebayes.exe)

Name is in reference to the song [Das Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Model) by Kraftwerk. The song has an [English](https://youtu.be/KFq2pU21cNU) and a [German](https://youtu.be/qCFIRjycV5Q) version, and I chose to name each of the sources after one of each of the translations. 

## [metropolis](/metropolis)
Please click [here](metropolis.md) for the table of contents contained within it. Contains mainly loose files that pertain to various projects such as their assignment pages or pictures of their execution. 

Name is a reference to [Metropolis](https://youtu.be/SXTBGB2cKAk) in which is a reference to a the [Fritz Lang film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)).

## [pocket-calculator](/pocket-calculator)
[pocket-calculator.cpp](/pocket-calculator/pocket-calculator.cpp) is the code from [project one](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration). This blurb contains everything that may be needed from a README for pocket-calculator. 

Program takes in data from Boston.csv and uses that data to find the sums, means, medians, and ranges of columns rm and medv. Program also determines correlation and covariance. 

- the formulas used can be found [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/formulas.png), 
- the execution images can be found [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/pocket-calculator-1.PNG), [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/pocket-calculator-2.PNG), and [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/pocket-calculator-3.PNG),
- a [pdf](/pocket-calculator/pocket-calculator-rstudio.pdf) of a quick Rstduio file to confirm numbers,
- the document with responses can be found [here](/pocket-calculator/CS4375-data-exploration-response.pdf),
- and an [executable](/pocket-calculator/pocket-calculator.exe) that can be run, given that [Boston.csv](/pocket-calculator/Boston.csv) is in the same folder

All of the main files can be found [here](/pocket-calculator), and all of the misc. files can be found in this [folder](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration). 

Name is a reference to [Pocket Calculator](https://youtu.be/eSBybJGZoCU) which just seemed fitting because this was a program that was calculating some data. 

## [radioactivity](/radioactivity)
[Code](/radioactivity/spotifyeval.rmd) {R} and [PDF form](radioactivity/spotifyeval.pdf) of evaluated data. 

Data comes from kaggle, at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushnitb/song-features-dataset-regressing-popularity?resource=download).

Name is a reference to a [Radioactivity](https://youtu.be/fM2Ddrg1eFI), in which they relay some atomic-era fears and use tones to create morse code in eigth notes. It is also a pun, in which it emphasizes the radio activity like popular songs. 

## [the-robots](/the-robots)
TODO: add wikipedia links, overview of program
- [data](/the-robots/perth.csv) : data used for analysis, home sale price data in Perth, Australia
- [r-source](/the-robots/SAE-Part3.Rmd) : the R Markdown file with all source chunks, includes notes about needed libraries (may have to manually install some libraries to run)
- [PDF](/the-robots/SAE-Part3-JML190001-Team7.pdf) : the knit file from the R source. Shows kMeans, Hierarchical, and Model clustering
TODO: add metropolis files
