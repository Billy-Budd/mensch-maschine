# mensch-maschine
Code and projects from CS4375.004 Machine Learning course with Karen Mazidi. 

Name is in reference to the Gesamtkunstwerk of Kraftwerk and their electronic music discography. [The Man-Machine or Die Mensch-Maschine](https://youtu.be/EPxGE1xWl_E?list=PLRp2a3r7tvpd3NpB_CwUbOoLxRgY4CwHh) is a 1978 electronic album that felt like an appropriate name and naming scheme for my projects in this machine learning course.
