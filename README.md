# [mensch-maschine](https://github.com/Billy-Budd/mensch-maschine/)
Code and projects from CS4375.004 Machine Learning course with Karen Mazidi. The document said to use underscores instead of spaces, but hyphens are more typical of the GitHub repositories that I've encountered, so I will be using hyphens. 

Included in this repo is [Overview-of-ML](Overview-of-ML.pdf) which contains the answers to questions to the [Assignment: Portfolio Setup](/metropolis/assignment-portfolio-setup/portfolio-setup.pdf), including the instructions to create a [GitHub portfolio](/metropolis/Assignment-Portfolio-Setup/create-github-portfolio.pdf).  

**Please note that each header in this file links to it's corresponding folder. I tried to include all of the links from metropolis as they came up, but a full table of contents can be found [here](metropolis.md).**

Name is in reference to the [Gesamtkunstwerk](https://www.theartstory.org/definition/gesamtkunstwerk/) of [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk), an early-electronica German band, and their electronic music discography. [The Man-Machine or Die Mensch-Maschine](https://youtu.be/EPxGE1xWl_E?list=PLRp2a3r7tvpd3NpB_CwUbOoLxRgY4CwHh) is a [1978 electronic album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man-Machine) that felt like an appropriate name and naming scheme for my projects in this machine learning course. 

## [blue-monday](/blue-monday)
TODO [data link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales-ratings)

Name is in reference to the song [Blue Monday](https://youtu.be/c1GxjzHm5us) by [New Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(band)) which [samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(New_Order_song)) the song [Uranium](https://youtu.be/t-QIWXiGuGw). While this is a bit of a stretch in the naming scheme, taking samples is important in data collection and statistics. I also really wanted to name something after Blue Monday. 

## [metropolis](/metropolis)
Please click [here](metropolis.md) for the table of contents contained within it. Contains mainly loose files that pertain to various projects such as their assignment pages or pictures of their execution. 

Name is a reference to [Metropolis](https://youtu.be/SXTBGB2cKAk) in which is a reference to a the [Fritz Lang film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)).

## [pocket-calculator](/pocket-calculator)
[pocket-calculator.cpp](/pocket-calculator/pocket-calculator.cpp) is the code from [project one](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration). This blurb contains everything that may be needed from a README for pocket-calculator. 

Program takes in data from Boston.csv and uses that data to find the sums, means, medians, and ranges of columns rm and medv. Program also determines correlation and covariance. 

- the formulas used can be found [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/formulas.png), 
- the execution images can be found [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/pocket-calculator-1.PNG), [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/pocket-calculator-2.PNG), and [here](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration/pocket-calculator-3.PNG),
- a [pdf](/pocket-calculator/pocket-calculator-rstudio.pdf) of a quick Rstduio file to confirm numbers,
- the document with responses can be found [here](/pocket-calculator/CS4375-data-exploration-response.pdf),
- and an [executable](/pocket-calculator/pocket-calculator.exe) that can be run, given that [Boston.csv](/pocket-calculator/Boston.csv) is in the same folder

All of the main files can be found [here](/pocket-calculator), and all of the misc. files can be found in this [folder](/metropolis/portfolio-one-data-exploration). 

Name is a reference to [Pocket Calculator](https://youtu.be/eSBybJGZoCU) which just seemed fitting because this was a program that was calculating some data. 

## [radioactivity](/radioactivity)
[Code](/radioactivity/spotifyeval.rmd) {R} and [PDF form](radioactivity/spotifyeval.pdf) of evaluated data. 

Data comes from kaggle, at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushnitb/song-features-dataset-regressing-popularity?resource=download).

Name is a reference to a [Radioactivity](https://youtu.be/fM2Ddrg1eFI), in which they relay some atomic-era fears and use tones to create morse code in eigth notes. It is also a pun, in which it emphasizes the radio activity like popular songs.
